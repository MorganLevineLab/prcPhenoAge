Description: This package performs a calculation of PhenoAge (2018) while subscoring the epigenetic age into
    the portion of PhenoAge reliant upon beta values annotated to be in PRC associated CpGs, and non-PRC associated
    CpGs. The PRC annotation is from the 27K CpGs, but the information is applicable to arrays of 450K and Illumina
    EPIC data.
